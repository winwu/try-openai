# Try openai

The repo is my practice playground for learning openai api.

## environment

I use python3 and my pip version is 23.1.2

```
pip3 install tiktoken
pip3 install load_dotenv
pip3 install openai
```

## File

1. 01_single_turn_tasks.py

as chatGPT accepts a list of messsage as input and generates messages as output,
but this file is a simple practice to try single-turn tasks without any conversation.


2. 02_multi_turn_conversations.py

a simple practice to try multiple conversation
